# exercism.io practice

This is my attempt at learning how to do some basic programming by doing the practice exercises at exercism.io.
I acknowledge that most of what you will find in here looks pretty hackish, but right now my goal is primarily to 
produce a solution without doing a whole lot of research. Only when I get stuck and can't get the tests to pass do I 
start digging into the interwebs. 

I've already learned quite a bit, but have no doubt that I'm missing some pretty easy best practice type stuff in my existing
solutions. 

## Goal
My goal is to be able to add some programming skills to my resume. Although I know I'll never get good enough to get a job as a 
fulltime developer, it seems more and more that some rudamentary programming skills are necessary to succeed in the professional
world.
